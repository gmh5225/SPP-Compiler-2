# Booleans
- Use the `Bool` object.
- While it is instantiable, the `true` and `false` literals are singleton instantiations of the `Bool` class.

## Program-long variables
- The `true` and `false` keyword refer to program-long variables.
- These variables are instantiated at the start of the program, and are immutable.
- They act as singleton instantiations of the `Bool` class.
