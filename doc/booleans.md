# Booleans
- Use the `Bool` object.
- While it is instantiable, the `true` and `false` literals are singleton instantiations of the `Bool` class.

## Program-long variables
- The `true` and `false` keyword refer to program-long variables.
- These variables are instantiated at the start of the program, and are immutable.
- They act as singleton instantiations of the `Bool` class.

## Operators
- All comparisons, logical and bitwise operators are overloaded for the `Bool` class.

## Linking to C's `bool` type
- The `Bool` class is a special, compiler-known class, which is linked to C's `bool` type.
- The `Bool` type is still an object
